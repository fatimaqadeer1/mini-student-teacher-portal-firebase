📚 Student–Teacher Portal

A Next.js + Firebase web application that provides a unified dashboard for teachers and students. The system streamlines attendance management, assignment distribution, and student submissions. Teachers can manage all class-related activities, while students can access a personalized portal for their learning needs.

🚀 Project Overview

This portal was developed to solve the problem of fragmented student–teacher interaction. Instead of handling attendance, assignments, and submissions separately, the portal centralizes everything:

Teachers can add attendees, mark daily attendance, and create or delete assignments.

Students can sign up and log in independently, view assignments, submit notes/links, and check attendance summaries.

The system ensures real-time updates using Firebase Firestore and provides secure login with Firebase Authentication.
